# ZorinLayoutsRevised
A script which simplifies the process of applying some Tweaks to the Zorin OS Desktop.

## this script currently handles:
- Automatically applying different Tweaks to the desktop through Gnome-Shell extensions, such as Pop-Shell or NoAnnoyance

## This script does NOT:
- Allow you to use or install Zorin's pro layouts on the Core variants (Please see Takedown.md for more information)
- Allow you to customize the lite editions

## Usage:
Simply paste this into your Terminal and hit `enter`:
```bash
bash -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TGRush/ZorinLayoutsRevised/main/morelayoutsinstall.sh -O -)"
```

> ###### Note that this script is currently going a little bit of a re-work, thus some things might be broken at the moment.

## Contributing:
When contributing (or trying to), make sure that you've tested your changes before you make a pull request, and that you relatively know how to use bash and some command line tools (wget for example, unzip, the gnome-extensions cli tool, etc) and that the change you're trying to pull request actually fits the project 

#### Changes which are considered NOT fitting the project:
- untested changes
- outdated extensions
- extensions installed forcibly (as in, outdated or too new for current GNOME version and thus installed through force)
- changing dconf where unnecessary
- custom extension downloading (already available through extensions.gnome.org as well as Extension Manager on Flathub)
- changes without a clear way of reverting them (for example changing the Kernel version...for whatever reason)
- breaking changes (for example PPAs which prevent proper updating)
