## The Zorin OS developers have kindly asked me to take down the previous version of Zorin-extra-Layouts
I have thus decided to create this, ZorinLayoutsRevised, with the Zorin Pro layouts removed.

from a legal perspective, I would've had every right to continue maintaining the script, but as I respect the Zorin Project, and I don't want to harm it in any way, **I have swiftly taken it down and replaced it by the repository you're in right now**

### The "Original" Zorin layouts will stay privated, and inquiries in my Private Messages on any platform regarding the Pro layouts will be ignored.
Feel free to customize your Zorin Desktop, use my Script to help in that, or not, you can also just get your extensions through [Extension Manager](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager) OR through the [Gnome Extensions Website](https://extensions.gnome.org)

Have a nice day, and thanks for reading :)
